Database project repository

When you run the application, you will encounter 3 initial inputs.
-First will ask you to insert your path to enter the folder, it should be of type: C:/pathnametofolder (you don't need to add the "/" at the end of the path, we have already done it for you)
-Then it will ask you for your username, that is the username you use to enter the localhost for mysql
-Lastly it will ask you for the password to enter the localhost

This is done so you can easily execute the application without having to edit the code itself. After doing this initial authentification, you will enter the application, create the database and populate the tables automatically. When the process is finished you will recieve an output line stating that the database has been created and the data has been loaded into the tables of the database. Afterwards you will recieve the 8 queries that you can choose to run.
